Move Oxcyon data into WordPress

== Description ==

**Back up your database before importing**
IMPORTANT: The import cannot be undone. MAKE SURE TO BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING THE PLUGIN.

# Oxcyon to WordPress

Plugin was developed to move an Oxcyon Centralpoint based website into WordPress. The plugin will take data from a
predetermined format and convert it into WordPress data.

Currently will import:

* Users
* Categories
* Tags
* Articles

Individual pages haven't been mapped yet, as well as other Oxcyon modules. I'm not deeply familiar with Oxcyon,
so I have only converted as much as I know.

# IMPORTANT #

## Security ##
For security, it's suggested to create a user specifically to import the data, as well as to export the data to a
database.

## Back Up Your Data ##
The import cannot be undone. MAKE SURE TO BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING THE PLUGIN.
